Academical Mentoring
======

Only computing science academical/applied research are conducted. Several projects were awarded at state and national science fairs. Apply only if you have similar goals. There is no need of high performance coefficient, however you must you must be available and motivated to work hard. If you are interested in working on a project with me as your adviser then check the requirements below.

- You must have at least 2 hours/week to dedicate research.
- You must understand English - Basic level.
- You must have minimal programming abilities in any programming language.
  - The PL must be appropriate to the proposed theme.
- You must keep in mind that you will not work with me. I will just guide you through the chosen topic. Choose a topic of interest, not an advisor.

Topics of research interest
======

- Robotics and Home Automation.
  - Trajectory tracking of wheeled mobile robots.
  - Multi robots systems.
  - Biometric systems with microcontrollers.
- Computer vision.
  - Identification and control of mobile robots in robot soccer.
  - Most topics related to digital image processing.
  - Optical Character Recognition.
- Information Security.
  - Cryptography.
