excerpt: 'This paper addresses the robust formation control of non-holonomic mobile robots with homogeneous system architecture and decentralized control structure. Therefore, it was necessary the mathematical modeling of mobile robots, from which, the Separation-Bearing variant of Leader-Following control strategy was implemented. The stability proof were based on the Lyapunov theory. The sliding mode control (SMC) strategy was used in the controller design to make the control robust to the incidence of uncertainties and disturbances. The Fuzzy Adaptive Formation Control is designed to eliminate the previous bounding knowledge of these uncertainties and disturbances. The proposed control effectiveness is demonstrated by results obtained with simulations in Matlab/Simulink. The pure kinematic and kinematic with disturbances is also analyzed. The results shows the controllers effectiveness to formation of multi-robots systems to the eight-shaped trajectory.'
