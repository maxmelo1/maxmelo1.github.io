excerpt: 'Manual golf-balls collecting in indoor driving ranges is a tedious task. The objective of this paper is to propose a method that contributes to automate the golf-balls collecting in indoor driving ranges. This method applies Mathematical Morphology and Artificial Intelligence to help the balls collecting. The proposal is represented by a program based on Mathematical Morphology applied to balls detection and Genetic Algorithm applied to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem to conduct a virtual robot for balls collecting in a virtualized intelligent indoor driving range. Images of balls scattered on the ground were processed to obtain the results. The results show the relevance of our project as a method to help balls collecting in indoor driving ranges. Our proposal contributes to the implementation of a low computational-cost method for automatic organization of driving ranges and to low computational-cost intelligent environments.'
