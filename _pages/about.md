I am a computer science master's degree student. I currently conduct research related to computational intelligence / computer vision, mainly related to convolutional neural networks. I also conduct research related to the control of the formation of mobile robots.

There are currently several research subjects in progress. Some of them are listed below.

Semantic segmentation of cattle loin eye area
======
This project is based in automatic segmentation and estimation of cattle loin eye area by convolutional neural networs.

Trajectory tracking of mobile robots
======
This project is based on encouraging high school students in robotics and educational robotics, in addition to validating the efficiency of a PID controller for trajectory tracking, developed from popular microcontroller and educational robotics kits.

Character recognition in natural images
======
This project is based on encouraging high school students in machine learning and proposes a pipeline to recognize 64 different characters.
